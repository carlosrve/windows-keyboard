Alternative keyboard layouts for Windows.

This stated because I use the US Intl. with dead keys on Linux. I like that layout as I can use US keyboards to write and to code very fast. I am a Spanish speaking person so I use a lot of accents and Ã±. But when I am coding I also use a lot of quotes, parentesis and brackets.

On Windows, with the US intl. keyboard layout, the quotes are a dead key, to have a quote you need to use a space or tap the key twice, which outputs two characters at once. This is not ideal.

This layout is a clone of the US intl. with dead keys from linux. It is missing some special dead keys I do not use. See the code TODOs for more info.

To compile and install this layout you need the Microsoft Windows Layout Creator (v1.4 at the moment of this writing) which in turn need the old 2.0 .NET Framework. You can activate old .NET Frameworks directly in the Control Panel, under the "Turn Windows features on and off" option.
